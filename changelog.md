# Changelog

## 1.1.3

Cleaned up a lot of duplicated and too complicated code.

Added icons locally.

Added "try again" button when fetching fails due to either bad connection or not being logged into reddit.

## 1.1.2

Fixed bug when removing posts from your reddit saved links.

Added [privacy policy](https://github.com/Friiiis/saved-posts-organizer/blob/master/privacypolicy.md)

## 1.1.1

Fixed bug that caused the app to not work at all for users that have saved comments (instead of only having saved posts). Thanks to GitHub user 19smitgr for the help.
It is now possible to see saved comments aswell. Saved comments will be shown as the title of the post the comment was made on, with a "(comment)" at the end.

Replaced some icons.

Fixed bug in permissions that made Chrome say, that the extension needs access to browser history.

## 1.0.0
