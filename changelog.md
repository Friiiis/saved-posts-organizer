Fixed bug when removing posts from your reddit saved links.

## 1.1.1

Fixed bug that caused the app to not work at all for users that have saved comments (instead of only having saved posts). Thanks to GitHub user 19smitgr for the help.
It is now possible to see saved comments aswell. Saved comments will be shown as the title of the post the comment was made on, with a "(comment)" at the end.

Fixed some wrong icons.

Fixed bug in permissions that made Chrome say, that the extension needs access to browser history.
